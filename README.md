# **OrderBookEngine**  
A high-performance **C++ Order Book** implementation with multithreading, priority queues, and real-time matching.  

## **Current Status**  
This project is in its **early development phase**, focused on building a **core order book structure** with efficient order matching. Right now, the implementation includes:  
âœ… **Basic order book structure** (bids & asks)  
âœ… **Limit order handling** with insertion/removal  
âœ… **Priority queue-based matching system**  

## **Upcoming Goals**  
ðŸ”¹ Implement **market orders & partial fills**  
ðŸ”¹ Improve **matching engine performance**  
ðŸ”¹ Introduce **multithreading** for concurrent order processing  
ðŸ”¹ Optimise **low-latency execution**  
ðŸ”¹ Add **backtesting support** for simulating market conditions  

## **Why This Project?**  
This is a learning-driven project to gain hands-on experience in:  
- **High-performance C++ development**  
- **Financial market infrastructure**  
- **Efficient data structures for real-time trading systems**  

## **Installation & Usage**  

## **Contributing**  
Open to feedback, suggestions, and collaboration! If you're experienced in **quant trading systems** or **low-latency optimisation**, feel free to reach out.
